      <p>
        {BRAND.name} gives independent cafés, restaurants and bars one page that every table&apos;s QR code opens: the menu, the Wi-Fi, a
        digital loyalty card, a private feedback box and an invitation to leave a Google review. Owners set it up themselves in about ten
        minutes, with no app for guests to download.
      </p>

      <h2>Why we built it</h2>
      <p>
        Small venues already pay for printed menus, paper stamp cards and review cards that get lost. {BRAND.name} puts all of them on the
        guest&apos;s own phone, helps venues hear from unhappy guests privately before they leave a bad review, and turns one-off visitors into
        regulars the venue can reach again, with their permission.
      </p>

      <h2>What&apos;s included</h2>
      <ul>
        {PLAN_FEATURES.map((feature) => (
          <li key={feature}>{feature}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>
        One plan with everything included: <strong>{priceSentence()}</strong>, per venue. Every venue starts with a {TRIAL_DAYS}-day free trial with no card needed. See our{" "}
        <Link href="/refunds">cancellation &amp; refund policy</Link>.
