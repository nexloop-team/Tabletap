        This policy explains what personal data {BRAND.name} handles, why, how long it&apos;s kept and the rights you have under India&apos;s
        Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (&ldquo;DPDP Act&rdquo;). {operatedByOther(legal) ? `${BRAND.name} is operated by ${legal.entityLabel}` : `${BRAND.name} is ${legal.entityType ?? "an Indian business"}`}, {legal.address}

        <strong>Two kinds of people use {BRAND.name}:</strong> <a href="#guests">guests</a> who scan a QR code at a café, restaurant or bar,
        and <a href="#owners">venue owners and their staff</a>, who run those pages.

      <h2 id="guests">Part A: Guests at a venue</h2>
      <p>
        When you scan a table QR code, the page that opens belongs to that venue. <strong>The venue is the Data Fiduciary</strong>: it decides
        what to ask you for and why. {BRAND.name} runs the page for the venue as its <strong>Data Processor</strong>, and uses your data only
        for that venue, never for itself and never for advertising.
      </p>

      <h3>What is collected, and why</h3>
      <div className="legal-scroll">
        <table className="legal-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>When you…</th>
              <th>Data</th>
              <th>Used to</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Join the loyalty card or members&apos; club</td>
              <td>Email, the name you type, stamps, rewards, visits</td>
              <td>Run your card, let staff find and stamp it, email you your card and tell you when a reward is ready</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Give your email for the Wi-Fi (if the venue asks)</td>
              <td>Email, first name, the visit</td>
              <td>Show you the Wi-Fi password and count your visits</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Tick &ldquo;Email me offers&rdquo; and confirm by email</td>
              <td>Your consent, and if you choose, your birthday (day and month, never the year)</td>
              <td>Send the venue&apos;s offers and news, a birthday treat and a &ldquo;we miss you&rdquo; note</td>
            </tr>

              <td>
                Pass your note privately to the venue, and summarise the week&apos;s notes for it with AI. Feedback isn&apos;t linked to your name or
                email; photos are re-encoded, which removes location data
              </td>
            </tr>

              <td>Use the page</td>
              <td>Which buttons are tapped, which table&apos;s QR code was scanned, a random ID for this visit, your network address</td>
              <td>Show the venue how its page is used, and protect the service from abuse (addresses are held in memory briefly, not stored)</td>

      </div>

      <h3>Consent, and taking it back</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Joining a card or getting on the Wi-Fi never requires agreeing to offers.</li>
        <li>You only get offers if you tick the box <em>and</em> confirm from the email we send. Each offer email has a one-tap unsubscribe link.</li>
        <li>
          You can delete your card and everything on it yourself, at any time, from the link at the bottom of your card&apos;s page. That
          withdraws your consent and erases your details at that venue.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Age</h3>
      <p>
        Under the DPDP Act anyone under 18 is a child, whose data needs a parent&apos;s consent. Guests at Indian venues confirm they&apos;re 18
        or older before agreeing to offers. If you&apos;re under 18, please don&apos;t join or give your email without your parent or guardian.
      </p>

      <h3>On your phone</h3>
      <p>
        We don&apos;t use advertising or tracking cookies. The page stores a few small values on your phone: which card or guest ID is yours
        at this venue (so you don&apos;t have to join again), a random visit ID that resets after 30 minutes without use, and whether you&apos;ve
        answered the birthday question.
      </p>

      <h3>How long it&apos;s kept</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your details, card and visits: while the venue&apos;s account exists, until you delete your card, or until the venue deletes you on request.</li>
        <li>Page-use records: 400 days. Copies of emails sent to you: 90 days, with private links removed.</li>
        <li>When a venue deletes its account, its guests&apos; data is erased. Backups roll over within 30 days.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="owners">Part B: Venue owners and staff</h2>
      <p>For your own account, <strong>{BRAND.name} is the Data Fiduciary</strong>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Account:</strong> your name, email and password (stored only as a one-way hash), and which venues you run or work at. Used to
          sign you in, run your venues and send service, security and billing emails, including a weekly summary you can switch off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Billing:</strong> your subscription status and Razorpay&apos;s customer and subscription IDs. Card, UPI and bank details go to
          Razorpay directly; we never see or store them.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Security:</strong> sign-in sessions (a cookie, kept 90 days from your last visit), a cookie on paired till devices, network
          addresses held in memory briefly to stop abuse, and a log of support actions our staff take on accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Retention:</strong> while your account exists. Deleting your account erases it, along with the venues only you own and their
          guests&apos; data. Razorpay keeps its payment records, and we keep invoices, for as long as tax law requires.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who else handles data</h2>
      <p>We use trusted service providers, bound by contract to use the data only for us. Some are outside India, which the DPDP Act allows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hosting, database and file storage (our cloud provider)</li>
        <li>Email delivery (Resend)</li>
        <li>Payments (Razorpay, for venue subscriptions only)</li>
        <li>Bot protection on sign-up (Cloudflare Turnstile)</li>
        <li>AI for owners: reading menu photos, and summarising a week&apos;s feedback notes (the note text only, never who wrote it)</li>
        {process.env.GOOGLE_NL_API_KEY && <li>Judging the tone of feedback notes (Google Cloud Natural Language; the text only, never who wrote it)</li>}
      </ul>
      <p>We don&apos;t sell personal data or share it for advertising. We disclose it to authorities only when the law requires.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Data is encrypted in transit, passwords and private links are stored hashed, access is limited to people who need it, and admin actions
        are logged. If a breach affects your data, we&apos;ll tell you and the Data Protection Board of India as the DPDP Act requires.
      </p>

      <h2>Your rights</h2>
      <p>Under the DPDP Act you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>ask what personal data is held about you and how it&apos;s used, and who it&apos;s been shared with;</li>
        <li>have it corrected, completed, updated or erased;</li>
        <li>withdraw consent at any time (as easily as you gave it);</li>
        <li>nominate someone to act for you if you die or can&apos;t act yourself;</li>
        <li>have a complaint dealt with by us, and then, if you&apos;re not satisfied, complain to the Data Protection Board of India.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Guests can ask the venue directly, or write to us and we&apos;ll pass it on and help. Owners can change most things in the dashboard or
        delete their account there. We reply within 30 days.
      </p>

      <h2 id="complaints">Questions and complaints</h2>
      <p>
        Email <a href={`mailto:${legal.supportEmail}`}>{legal.supportEmail}</a>. We acknowledge complaints within 48 hours and resolve them
        within 30 days. See also <Link href="/contact">Contact us</Link>.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>
        If we change this policy in a way that matters, we&apos;ll update the date above and, for owners, email you first. Guests will see the
        new version linked from the page.
