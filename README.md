# Tabletap — self-serve QR pages for hospitality venues

Venue owners sign up, answer four onboarding questions and get a live guest page with printable QR codes, all without help from us. A guest who scans a table QR code gets the menu, Wi-Fi, a loyalty card that staff stamp at the till, a private feedback box with a Google review invitation for every guest, and a Sudoku to pass the time. Owners manage everything from a dashboard and pay one yearly subscription per venue. Guest-page behaviour is modelled on the analysis in [docs/candour-analysis.md](docs/candour-analysis.md), with our own brand, copy and backend.

Plans, to-dos, decisions and the change log live in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## Run it

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:3000
pnpm test         # unit tests (vitest)
pnpm lint
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

Requires Node 22+. The database is **PostgreSQL**:

- **Locally, with nothing set up**, the app runs an embedded Postgres ([PGlite](https://pglite.dev)) saved in `./data/pg`. Uploaded images and feedback photos go to `./data/` too (override with `DATA_DIR`). Only one process can open that local database at a time.
- **With `DATABASE_URL` set**, it connects to that server instead: Supabase, Neon, AWS RDS or your own Postgres. Moving between hosts is a change of that one URL plus a data copy (`pg_dump` / `pg_restore`).

Migrations run automatically on start; restart the dev server after pulling a schema change.

**Coming from the old SQLite version?** Stop the app, then copy everything across once:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-sqlite-to-postgres.mjs                    # into the local ./data/pg
DATABASE_URL=postgres://… node scripts/migrate-sqlite-to-postgres.mjs   # into Supabase or your server
```

It creates the tables if needed, skips rows that are already there, and with `S3_*` set it also uploads the images.

### Try the owner flow locally

1. Open `/signup` and create an account. You land in the onboarding wizard, and the venue starts on a 7-day free trial (no card).
2. Edit the guest page, menu and loyalty settings from the dashboard. The phone preview reloads on save.
3. Download QR codes or a print sheet of table cards from **QR codes**.
4. Emails aren't sent in development. They go to the `outbox` table and the server log, so copy the verification or reset link from there.
5. To see `/admin`, put your email in `ADMIN_EMAILS` and verify it.
6. Billing runs in **dev mode** without Razorpay keys: "Subscribe" switches the venue on for a year instantly and "Cancel subscription" ends it straight away.

Three demo venues are seeded on first start (free access, no owner; hidden from the admin console and its numbers):

| URL | Shows |
|---|---|
| `/s?i=demo` | Stamp card with reward tiers, hosted menu, plain Wi-Fi, Sudoku |
| `/s?i=demo-crm` | Honeycomb Café: Bento tiles on White & Honey, Indian menu (₹, veg / non-veg marks), Wi-Fi email gate, marketing consent, birthday ask |
| `/s?i=demo-rewards` | Rewards-only membership, external ordering link, custom link cards |

## Subscription

One plan, billed per venue: **₹999 a year**, with a **7-day free trial** and no card needed. Every feature is included. No GST is charged while the business isn't GST-registered; once it is, set `CHARGES_GST = true` in `src/lib/plans.ts` (prices then show ₹999 + 18% GST, ₹1,178.82 in total) and set `GSTIN`.

When a venue has neither a paid subscription nor trial days left, its guest page (and everything guests reach through it: menu, loyalty card, till stamping) goes offline. The owner can still sign in, edit and subscribe, and the page comes back exactly as it was. A failed renewal keeps the page up while Razorpay retries; it goes offline when Razorpay halts the subscription. Prices and the access rules live in `src/lib/plans.ts`.

## Going to production

1. **Database and files:**
   1. Set `DATABASE_URL` to your Postgres.
      - **Supabase:** Project → Connect → copy the **Session pooler** string (IPv4, port 5432), with your database password filled in.
      - **Self-hosted:** `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/tabletap`, plus `DATABASE_SSL=off` if it has no TLS.
      - To have the server's certificate checked, set `DATABASE_SSL_CA` to the provider's CA (PEM text or a file path; Supabase: Project Settings → Database → SSL Configuration), or `DATABASE_SSL=verify` for a publicly signed certificate. Without either the link is encrypted but unchecked, and startup warns.
   2. For images, set the `S3_*` variables to a bucket.
      - **Supabase:** Storage → create a private bucket `tabletap` → Storage settings → S3 access keys. Use the endpoint shown there (`https://<project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/s3`) and the project's region.
      - **MinIO, R2 or AWS:** use their endpoint and keys.
   3. Without `S3_*`, images stay on the server's disk under `DATA_DIR`. That needs a persistent volume, so it won't work on serverless hosts.
   4. Check both before starting: `node --env-file=.env.local scripts/check-connections.mjs`.
   5. Run a single instance, because rate limits are kept in memory. They read the visitor's address from the proxy's end of `X-Forwarded-For`: set `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT=2` with Cloudflare in front of the host, or `CLIENT_IP_HEADER` to a header your CDN sets.
   6. Every table has row-level security on with no policies. Supabase's automatic REST API can't read them; the app connects as the tables' owner and isn't affected.
2. **Set `APP_URL`** to your public origin (e.g. `https://tabletap.app`). It's encoded into every QR code, so it must never change.
3. **Email:** create a [Resend](https://resend.com) account, verify your sending domain, then set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `MAIL_FROM`.
4. **Razorpay:**
   1. In the Razorpay dashboard, create a yearly plan (Subscriptions → Plans) for ₹999 (₹1,178.82 once GST is charged), and set `RAZORPAY_PLAN_ID`.
   2. Create API keys and set `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`.
   3. Add a webhook at `https://<your-domain>/api/billing/webhook` for the `subscription.*` events (activated, charged, pending, halted, cancelled, completed, paused, resumed), and set `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
   4. Owners subscribe in Razorpay Checkout on the Subscription page; the signed payment response switches the venue on at once, and the webhook keeps renewals and cancellations in step.
   5. Without keys in production, payments are disabled and the Subscription page asks owners to email support.
   6. Without GST registration, Razorpay can activate a partnership or proprietorship with a Udyam certificate instead of a GSTIN (plus one more business proof, such as a Shop & Establishment licence). Once GST-registered, add the GSTIN in Razorpay so it issues GST invoices.
5. **Set `ADMIN_EMAILS`** to your own address(es), and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORT_EMAIL` to the address owners and guests should write to (read at build time, so rebuild after changing it).
6. **Backups:**
   - **Database:** Supabase backs it up daily on paid plans. Elsewhere, schedule `pg_dump`.
   - **Images:** they're in the bucket, or in `DATA_DIR` if you kept them on disk.
7. **Legal pages (India).** Set the business details below; the pages show "[… not set]" until you do, and startup lists what's missing. Then have a lawyer review the pages before launch.
   - `/terms`, `/privacy` (DPDP Act 2023 notice for guests and owners), `/refunds` (cancellation and refunds), `/shipping` (delivery policy for an online service) and `/contact` (business details and where to send complaints). Razorpay checks all five before activating payments.
   - The refund windows are a business choice: they're constants at the top of [refunds/page.tsx](src/app/refunds/page.tsx). Change `POLICIES_UPDATED` in [config/legal.ts](src/config/legal.ts) whenever a policy's wording changes.
   - Only charge GST once you're GST-registered, and set `GSTIN` then.
8. **Check the log after the first start.** In production the server lists every setting a launch still needs ([env-check.ts](src/server/env-check.ts)).

## Routes

**Owners**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/` | Marketing page with pricing and demos |
| `/signup`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` | Accounts (email + password) |
| `/onboarding` | Four-step wizard that creates a venue |
| `/dashboard` | Venue list (or straight into your only venue) |
| `/dashboard/<venue>` | Overview: scans, guests, feedback, setup checklist |
| `/dashboard/<venue>/design`, `/menu`, `/loyalty` | Editors for the guest page, menus and loyalty/capture |
| `/dashboard/<venue>/guests`, `/feedback` | Guest list (with CSV export) and feedback inbox |
| `/dashboard/<venue>/qr`, `/qr/print` | QR downloads (PNG/SVG, per-table sources) and printable table cards |
| `/dashboard/<venue>/billing`, `/settings` | Plan, venue details, page address, delete venue |
| `/dashboard/account` | Name, password, delete account |
| `/admin` | Operator view: all accounts and venues, suspend, extend trials, give free access, cancel a renewal, delete a venue, revenue, account actions (resend emails, reset link, block, delete) and an activity log of every admin change |
| `/staff`, `/staff/stamp?c=<card>` | Till screens for paired staff devices: find a member, add stamps, redeem rewards, undo |

**Guests**

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `/s?i=<code>&s=<source>` | Landing page (server-rendered, venue theme applied before first paint). `cta=box\|anon` forces the feedback-card A/B variant. |
| `/menu?i=<code>` | Hosted menu: search, section jump bar, allergen filter, dietary tags |
| `/card/<id>?t=<token>` | Member's web card (linked from the enrolment email), where they can also delete their card and details |
| `/consent?token=` | The double-opt-in link: a Confirm button (email scanners open links, so confirming takes a tap) |
| `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/refunds`, `/shipping`, `/contact` | Privacy policy (DPDP), terms, cancellation and refunds, delivery policy, contact |
| `/unsubscribe?token=` | Stop offer emails from one venue (also one-click from mail apps) |
| `/media/<venue>/<file>` | Images uploaded by owners |

**APIs:** `api/auth/*`, `api/account`, `api/dashboard/venues/*` and `api/admin/*` are cookie-authenticated, and their writes are refused from other origins. `api/billing/webhook` is signed by Razorpay. The guest APIs (`api/venues`, `api/loyalty`, `api/feedback`, `api/guests`, `api/consent`, `api/events`) are unchanged.

## Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with scrypt. Sessions are random tokens in an HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax cookie, stored hashed in `sessions`. A password reset or change signs out other devices.
- Every dashboard page and API checks venue ownership on the server. `src/proxy.ts` only does an early redirect to the login page.
- Uploads are identified by their bytes (JPEG/PNG/WebP/GIF only, so no SVG) and capped at 5 MB. Guests' feedback photos are only served to the venue's owner.
- Saved configs pass a strict zod schema (`src/lib/venue/schema.ts`): http(s) links only, hex colours only, length limits.
- Guests can't earn stamps on their own: a feedback stamp needs the one-time receipt from that feedback post, and join stamps are decided by the server. A returning member is emailed their card link, never shown it, since anyone can type an email.
- Behind the Wi-Fi email gate, the password isn't sent to the page until the guest has given an email.
- Old page addresses stay tied to their venue (and deleted venues' addresses stay reserved), so a printed QR code can never lead to someone else's page.
- Pages can only be framed by our own (dashboard preview), with HSTS, nosniff and a strict referrer policy on every response.
- A daily clean-up deletes expired sessions and links, email copies after 90 days and page analytics after 400 days. Email copies keep no working private links once real email is on.

## Code map

- `src/app/` holds the routes: pages and `api/*` handlers.
- `src/components/landing/` holds the guest page. `src/components/dashboard/` holds the owner UI: editors, wizard and shell.
- `src/lib/` holds pure logic shared by client and server: plans, venue schema and entitlements, theme, feature rules, validation, i18n, sudoku, API contracts.
- `src/server/` holds the database, auth, repositories and services. Only route handlers and server pages import it.
